## Scala with Cats (notes and solutions)

This is just a place for me to dump notes while reading
[Scala with Cats](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/),
along with my solutions as I work through the exercises
(yes, there are solutions in the book already).

* [Chapter 1. Introduction](ch1)
* [Chapter 2. Monoids and Semigroups](ch2)
* [Chapter 3. Functors](ch3)
* [Chapter 4. Monads](ch4)
